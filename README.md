# TweetLookup
This is a simple tweet extractor program that lists all the tweets containing the searched word.  

This is a tweet extractor program that looks up for a given term on twitter. The program takes as an input 
a search keyword and also takes the number of tweets to be considered. The resultant set of tweets is systematically   
stored in a text file for later use. If there is no tweet corresponding to that search word, an appropriate dialog box  
is shown. This is the first step for any twitter sentiment analysis program.
