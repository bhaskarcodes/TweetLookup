# TwitterLookup
This is a simple tweet extractor program that lists all the tweets containing the searched word.  

##Version 1.1

Basic sentiment analysis has been implemented using Python and TextBlob library. Also, results obtained from the analysis can be viewed on a pie chart plotted using JFreeChart. Additional links and other non BMP characters have been filtered to enable text based sentiment analysis.

##Version 1.0

This is a tweet extractor program that looks up for a given term on twitter. The program takes as an input 
a search keyword and also takes the number of tweets to be considered. The resultant set of tweets is systematically   
stored in a text file for later use. I used twitter4j to set up the configuration and get the tweets. If there is no tweet corresponding to that search word, an appropriate dialog box  
is shown. This is the first step for any twitter sentiment analysis program.
